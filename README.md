## Musical Instrument Management System
This project is a react implementation of basic lookup and edit features in a database geared towards managing instruments for a musical organization (namely, schools).  It's mostly a way for me to learn react, but I've put it here in case it's useful to others.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
